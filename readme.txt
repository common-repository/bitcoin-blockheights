Bitcoin Blockheight is a straight-forward plugin that fetches the current Bitcoin Blockheight and adds it to your Wordpress posts, under or beside the post date field.

## Description

This plugin offers limited support. This is something I had developed for my own blog (Bombthrower.com) and decided to release it because a lot Bitcoiners have taken to referring to the blockheight as a kind of timestamp.

In the back of my mind I have the idea that if it becomes widely used, I may add options to link the blockheight field to an on-chain copy of the post somewhere, like IPFS (or maybe an ordinal).

== Screenshots ==

1. The current blockheight is fetched when you publish your post
2. There are a few methods to control display, including a shortcode
3. The blockheight shows up as if it were a date field

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### How does it get the blockheight?

It makes a call to an endpoint maintained on a server here, it's just a .txt file with the current blockheight. There's cronjob that populates that from a nearby Bitcoin node on our network. 

### Does it support any other blockchains? Like Ethereum?

No. Next question.

### Does it update the blockheight for a post when it is revised? 

Not yet. This may be added if there is any demand for it.
